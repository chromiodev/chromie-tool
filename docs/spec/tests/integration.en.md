# Integration tests: chromio


## Introduction

This document defines the integration test cases for the **chromio** library.
The objective is to validate the correct interaction between its internal modules and with external services, mainly a real instance of the **Chroma** database.

The methodology used is **gray-box** testing, where there is knowledge of the internal architecture and the interfaces of the components to be integrated, but not of their detailed implementation.


## Scope

The tests focus on the integration of the following components and workflows of the **chromio** library:

- **`client`** module:
  Creation and management of Chroma clients from a URI.

- **`ie`** (*Import/Export*) module:
  The implementation of exporters and importers with a **Chroma** database instance.

- **Full workflow**:
  The ability to export data from a collection and re-import it, verifying data integrity.


## Test environment

The execution environment for the integration tests has the following configuration.

Dependency | Type | Description
:--: | :--: | :--
Hardware | Internal | Machine with at least 2GB of RAM
Operating system | Internal | Ubuntu 24.04
Python | Internal | 3.13
Test framework | Internal | pytest 8.4
Chroma | External | Docker chromadb/chroma

The tests will be located in the **tests/integration** directory of the project.
Each test file must have the prefix **itg_** and the suffix **_test.py**, for example, *itg_exp_test.py*.


## Test cases

A test case is considered **successful** if the interaction between the components produces the result and the final state defined in the expected output and post-conditions.

### Client connectivity (*CL*)

  createClient@{ shape: "rounded", label: "Create client" }

  subgraph "Test cases"
    createServerClient@{ shape: "rounded", label: "#lt;#lt;testcase>><br>ITG-CL-01: Server client creation" }
  end

  createServerClient -.-> createClient
```

#### Server client creation (*ITG-CL-01*)

- **Description**:
  Checks that a **chromio** client (***`ChromioClient`***) can be created from a valid URI to an accessible **Chroma** server.

- **Type**:
  Read.

- **Pre-conditions**:
  
  - A running **Chroma** instance accessible over the network.

- **Post-conditions**:

  - A successful connection is established with the **Chroma** server.

- **Expected Output**:

  - The method returns an **`AsyncClientAPI`** instance representing an active connection to the database server.

### Data export (*EXP*)

  %% use cases
  exportColl@{ shape: "rounded", label: "Export a collection" }

  subgraph "Test cases"
    exportFullColl@{ scope="rounded", label: "#lt;#lt;testcase>>ITG-EXP-01: Full export" }
    exportPartialColl@{ scope="rounded", label: "#lt;#lt;testcase>>ITG-EXP-02: Partial export" }
  end

  exportFullColl -.-> exportColl
  exportPartialColl -.-> exportColl
```

#### Full export (*ITG-EXP-01*)

- **Description**:
  Checks that **`CollExporter.export_coll()`** exports all records from a collection when no limit is specified.
- **Type**:
  Read.
  - **Pre-conditions**:

    - The collection contains more than two records.

- **Post-conditions**:

  - An export file is generated in **JSON** format.

  - The file contains the same number of items as records in the collection.

  - All records have the **`id`**, **`metadata`**, and **`document`** fields.
- **Expected output**:

  The method returns a report object indicating the exact number of exported records and the path to the generated file.

#### Partial export (*ITG-EXP-02*)

- **Description**:
  Checks that **`CollExporter.export_coll()`** exports a maximum number of records equal to the specified **`limit`**.

- **Type**:
  Read.

- **Pre-conditions**:

  - The collection contains more records than the limit to be applied (***2***).

- **Post-conditions**:

  - An export file is generated in **JSON** format.

  - The file contains exactly the same number of items as specified in **`limit`**.

- **Expected Output**:

  - The method returns a report object indicating the number of exported records, which matches the **`limit`**.

### Data import (*IMP*)

  %% use cases
  importColl@{ shape: "rounded", label: "Import to a collection" }

  subgraph "Test cases"
    importFullColl@{ scope="rounded", label: "#lt;#lt;testcase>>ITG-IMP-01: Full import" }
    importPartialColl@{ scope="rounded", label: "#lt;#lt;testcase>>ITG-IMP-02: Partial import" }
  end

  importFullColl -.-> importColl
  importPartialColl -.-> importColl
```

#### Full import (ITG-IMP-01)

- **Description**:
  Checks that **`CollImporter.import_coll()`** imports all records from a file into an empty collection when no limit is specified.

- **Type**:
  R/W.

- **Pre-conditions**:

  - The import file is valid and contains at least two records.

  - The destination collection exists and is empty.

- **Post-conditions**:

  - The destination collection contains the same number of records as the import file.

- **Expected Output**:

  - The method returns a report object indicating the specific number of imported records.

#### Partial import (*ITG-IMP-02*)

- **Description**:
  Checks that **`CollImporter.import_coll()`** imports a maximum number of records equal to the specified `limit`.

- **Type**:
  R/W.

- **Pre-conditions**:

  - The import file contains more records than the limit to be applied (***2***).

  - The destination collection exists and is empty.

- **Post-conditions**:

  - The destination collection contains exactly the number of records specified in `limit`.

- **Expected Output**:

  - The method returns a report object indicating the number of imported records, which matches the **`limit`**.

### Data copy (*CP*)
